# Title: Analyzing Workout Data

## Description
Analyzing workout data involves examining the step count recorded in a health log. The goal of this project is to develop a function that identifies the longest streak of consecutive days with a given number of steps. This function will determine the start and end dates of the longest streak.

Within the project's branches, each streak's start and end dates are displayed. Finally, the streaks are presented in a pandas dataframe for easy visualization.

## About the Data
This dataset is a subset of a larger health log project. It includes two main columns:
- Date: Formatted as Year-Month-Date.
- Step Count: The number of steps taken on each day.
